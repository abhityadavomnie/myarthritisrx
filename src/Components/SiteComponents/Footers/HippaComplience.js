                            <br />
                            We understand that medical information about you and your health is
                            private and personal. We are dedicated to maintaining the privacy and
                            integrity of the protected health information that we receive from you
                            as part of your application for or participation in the Services
                            (“PHI”). PHI is information about you that we receive from you as part
                            of your application for or participation in the Services that may be
                            used to identify you (such as your name, social security number, or
                            address), and that relates to (a) your past, present, or future physical
                            or mental health or condition, (b) the provision of health care to you,
                            or (c) your past, present, or future payment for the provision of health
                            care. In providing services to you, we will receive and create records
                            containing your PHI. We need these records to provide you with quality
                            care and to comply with certain legal requirements.
                            <br />
                            We are required by law to maintain the privacy of your PHI and to
                            provide you with notice of our legal duties and privacy practices with
                            respect to your PHI. When we use or disclose your PHI, we are required
                            to abide by the terms of this Notice (or other Notice in effect at the
                            time of the use or disclosure).
                            <br />
                            This Notice applies to the records of services you receive at or from
                            MyArthritisRx, whether created by our staff or your doctor. Your doctor
                            and other health care providers may have different practices or notices
                            about their use and sharing of medical information in their own offices
                            or clinics. We will gladly explain this Notice to you or your family

                                3. How We May Use and Disclose Protected Health Information About You
                            </strong>
                            <br />
                            This section of our Notice tells how we may use PHI about you. We will
                            protect PHI as much as we can under the law. Sometimes state law gives
                            more protection to PHI than federal law. Sometimes federal law gives
                            more protection than state law. In each case, we will apply the laws
                            that protect PHI the most.
                            <br />
                            We are required to maintain the confidentiality of your PHI, and we have
                            policies and procedures and other safeguards to help protect your PHI
                            from improper use and disclosure. The following categories describe
                            different ways that we use your PHI within MyArthritisRx and disclose
                            your PHI to persons and entities outside of MyArthritisRx. We have not
                            listed every use or disclosure within the categories below, but all
                            permitted uses and disclosures will fall within one of the following
                            categories. In addition, there are some uses and disclosures that will
                            require your specific authorization.
                            <br />
                            How much PHI may legally be used or disclosed without your written
                            permission will vary depending, for example, on the intended purpose of
                            the use or disclosure. Sometimes we may only need to use or disclose a
                            limited amount of PHI, such as to send you a reminder or to confirm your
                            health insurance coverage. At other times, we may need to use or
                            disclose more PHI such as when a doctor is providing medical treatment.

                                Disclosure at your request. We may disclose information when requested
                                by you. This disclosure at your request may require written
                                authorization by you.

                                Treatment. This is the most important use and disclosure of your PHI.
                                We may use and disclose your PHI to a physician or health care
                                provider to provide treatment and other services to you. For example,
                                our staff and health care personnel, including trainees, involved in
                                your care may use and disclose your PHI to evaluate your health care
                                needs. In addition, we may contact you to provide reminders or
                                information about treatment alternatives or other health-related
                                benefits and services that may be of interest to you. We may also
                                disclose PHI to other providers involved in your treatment.

                                Payment. We may use and disclose your PHI to obtain payment for
                                services that we provide to you. For example, we may make disclosures
                                to claim and obtain payment from your health insurer, HMO, or other
                                company that arranges or pays the cost of some or all of your health
                                care (“Your Payor”) or to verify that Your Payor will pay for health

                                Health care operations. We may use and disclose your PHI for our
                                health care operations and the health care operations of certain other
                                entities that have or have had a relationship with you. These health
                                care operations include internal administration and planning and
                                various activities that improve the quality and cost effectiveness of
                                the care delivered to you. Examples include, but are not limited to,
                                using information about you to improve quality of care, quality
                                assessment activities, disease management programs, patient

                                require our business associates to sign a contract or written
                                agreement stating that they will appropriately safeguard your PHI.

                                of interest to you.

                                a family member or other person involved in your care will be present
                                when we are discussing your PHI with you. We may use or disclose your
                                PHI to a family member, other relative, a close personal friend or any
                                other person identified by you when you are present for, or otherwise
                                available prior to, the disclosure, if we (1) obtain your agreement;
                                (2) provide you with the opportunity to object to the disclosure and
                                you do not object; or (3) reasonably infer that you do not object to

                                are not present, or the opportunity to agree or object to a use or
                                disclosure cannot practicably be provided because of your incapacity

                                determine whether a disclosure is in your best interest. If we
                                disclose information to a family member, other relative, or a close
                                personal friend, we would disclose only information that we believe is
                                directly relevant to the person’s involvement with your health care or
                                payment related to your health care. We may also disclose your PHI in
                                order to notify (or assist in notifying) such persons of your
                                location, general condition or death.

                                health and safety of the public or another person. Any disclosure,
                                however, would only be to someone able to help prevent the threat as
                                determined by us in good faith.

                                believe you are a victim of abuse, neglect, or domestic violence, we
                                may disclose your PHI to a governmental authority, including a social
                                service or protective services agency, authorized by law to receive
                                reports of such abuse, neglect, or domestic violence.

                                activities include, for example, audits, investigations, inspections,
                                and licensure. These activities are necessary for the government to
                                monitor the health care system, government programs, and compliance
                                with civil rights laws.

                                permitted by law without your authorization, for example, to defend a
                                lawsuit or arbitration.

                                certain limited circumstances, we are unable to obtain the person’s
                                agreement; (4) about a death we believe may be the result of a

                                crime or victims; or the identity, description or location of the

                                Research that does not involve your treatment. When a research study
                                does not involve any treatment, we may disclose your PHI to
                                researchers. To do this, we will either ask your permission to use
                                your PHI or we will use a special process that protects the privacy of
                                your PHI. In addition, we may use information that cannot be
                                identified as your PHI, but that includes certain limited information
                                (such as your date of birth and dates of service). We will use this
                                information for research, quality assurance activities, and other
                                similar purposes and, if we disclose this limited information, we will
                                obtain special protections for the information disclosed.

                                units of the government with special functions, such as the U.S.
                                military or the U.S. Department of State, under certain circumstances.
                                We may use and disclose your PHI to authorized federal officials for
                                intelligence, counterintelligence, and other national security
                                activities authorized by law. We may use and disclose your PHI to
                                authorized federal officials so they may provide protection to the
                                President, other authorized persons or foreign heads of state, or
                                conduct special investigations.

                                Inmates. If you are an inmate of a correctional institution or under
                                custody of a law enforcement official, we may disclose PHI about you
                                to the correctional institution or the law enforcement official. This
                                is necessary for the correctional institution to provide you with
                                health care, to protect your health and safety and the health and
                                safety of others, and to protect the safety and security of the
                                correctional institution.

                                to the extent necessary to comply with state laws relating to workers’
                                compensation or other similar programs.

                                do so by any other law not already referred to in the preceding
                                categories. For example, the Secretary of the Department of Health and
                                Human Services may review our compliance efforts, which may include
                                seeing your PHI.

                            <br />
                            If there are reasons we need to use your PHI that have not been
                            described in the sections above, we will obtain your written permission.
                            This permission is described as a written “authorization.” If you
                            authorize us to use or disclose PHI about you, you may revoke that
                            authorization in writing at any time. If you revoke your authorization,
                            we will no longer use or disclose PHI about you for the reasons stated
                            in your written authorization, except to the extent we have already
                            acted in reliance on your authorization. You understand that we are
                            unable to take back any disclosures we have already made with your
                            permission, and we are required to retain our records of the care we
                            provide to you. Some typical disclosures that require your authorization
                            are:

                                Special categories of treatment information. In most cases, federal or
                                state law requires your written authorization or the written
                                authorization of your representative for disclosures of drug and
                                alcohol abuse treatment, Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) and
                                Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) test results, and mental
                                health treatment.

                                Research involving your treatment. When a research study involves your
                                treatment, we may disclose your PHI to researchers only after you have
                                signed a specific written authorization. In addition, an Institutional
                                Review Board (IRB) will already have reviewed the research proposal,
                                established appropriate procedures to ensure the privacy of your PHI
                                and approved the research. You do not have to sign the authorization,
                                but if you refuse you cannot be part of the research study and may be
                                denied research-related treatment.

                                Fundraising activities. We may use demographic information and your
                                dates of service for our own fundraising purposes, otherwise we will
                                obtain your authorization. You may revoke any authorization at any
                                time, in writing, but only as to future uses or disclosures, and only
                                if we have not already acted in reliance on a previous authorization
                                from you. If you do not want us to contact you for fundraising
                                efforts, you must notify us in writing at the address listed at the
                                end of this Notice.

                                Marketing. We must also obtain your written authorization (“Your
                                Marketing Authorization”) prior to using your PHI to send you any
                                marketing materials. We can, however, provide you with marketing
                                materials in a face-to-face encounter without obtaining Your Marketing
                                Authorization. We are also permitted to give you a promotional gift of
                                nominal value, if we so choose, without obtaining Your Marketing
                                Authorization. In addition, we may communicate with you about products
                                or services relating to your treatment, case management or care
                                coordination, or alternative treatments, therapies, providers or care
                                settings without Your Marketing Authorization. If we receive any
                                direct or indirect payment for making such a communication, however,
                                we would need your prior written permission to contact you. The only
                                exceptions for seeking such permission are when our communication (i)
                                describes only a drug or medication that is currently being prescribed
                                for you and our payment for the communication is reasonable in amount;
                                or (ii) is made by one of our business partners consistent with our
                                written agreement with the business partner.

                                on our use and disclosure of your PHI (1) for treatment, payment and
                                health care operations, (2) to individuals (such as a family member,
                                other relative, close personal friend or any other person identified
                                by you) involved with your care or with payment related to your care,

                                regarding your location and general condition. While we will consider
                                all requests for additional restrictions carefully, we are not
                                required to agree to a requested restriction, unless the request is
                                regarding a disclosure to a health plan for a payment or health care
                                operation purpose and the PHI relates solely to a health care item or
                                service for which we have been paid out-of-pocket in full. This
                                request must be in writing. We will send you a written response. If we
                                agree with the request, we will comply with your request except to the

                                If you desire to amend your records, your request must be in writing.
