                                                Generally, our Services automatically collect usage
                                                information, such as the numbers and frequency of visitors to
                                                the Site and Mobile App and its components, similar to TV
                                                ratings that indicate how many people watched a particular
                                                show. We only use this data in aggregate form, that is, as a
                                                statistical measure, and not in a manner that would permit us
                                                to identify you personally (“De-identified Information”). This
                                                type of aggregate data enables us to figure out how often
                                                users or customers use parts of the Site, Mobile App or
                                                Services so that we can make the Site, Mobile App and Services
                                                as appealing to as many users and customers as possible and
                                                improve our Services. We may provide this de-identified,
                                                aggregate data to our partners and/or customers to identify
                                                how our users use our Site, Mobile App and/or Services. Again,
                                                we never disclose information to a partner or customer in a
                                                manner that would identify you personally.

                                                if your computer supports this type of program. We use this

                                                helpful. We also compare our customer list to lists received
                                                from other companies in an effort to avoid sending unnecessary

                                                Services, you may limit program reminders and other valuable

                                                a variety of third party businesses. In certain situations,

                                                sell products, jointly with affiliated businesses. You should

                                                with your transactions, and throughout the course of the
