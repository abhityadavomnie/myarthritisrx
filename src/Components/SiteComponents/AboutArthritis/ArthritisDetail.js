                <p>
                    Arthritis refers to inflammation of a joint which can affect any of the
                    important structures inside a joint, including the joint lining
                    (synovium), bones, cartilage, or supporting tissues. Common symptoms
                    include <b>chronic arthritis pain</b>, stiffness, and swelling of the
                    joint. The condition may affect one or several joints throughout the body
                    with <b>knee joint pain </b> being a common symptom. Degeneration of the
                    cartilage can lead to destruction of the joint and the need for total
                    joint replacement.
