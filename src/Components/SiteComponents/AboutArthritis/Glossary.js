          <strong>All-natural:</strong> Does not contain synthetic or artificial
          ingredients.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Antibody:</strong> A molecule made by the body that works as a
          “tag” on other molecules and marks them for destruction by the immune
          system.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Biomarkers:</strong> Molecules found in tissue that can provide
          information about the tissue or the person. For example, cholesterol is
          used to determine whether a patient needs cholesterol-lowering
          medication.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Cartilage:</strong> A type of tissue that provides a
          viscoelastic, shock-absorbing matrix at the ends of bones. Cartilage
          allows bones to rub against each other in a non-damaging way.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Cholesterol-free:</strong> Containing less than 2mg cholesterol
          per serving and 2 grams or less of saturated fat per serving.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Chondroitin sulfate:</strong> A molecule naturally found in
          cartilage. This a mixture of protein and carbohydrate and is disputed as
          either beneficial or unbeneficial when taken over the counter as a
          supplement.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Collagen:</strong> One of the most abundant proteins in the
          human body and a key property of cartilage. It is capable of stretching
          and absorbing shock.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Corticosteroid:</strong> A molecule that the body can produce,
          which can also be injected into tissues to prevent inflammation. Can
          provide instant relief to patients that have symptoms of pain and
          swelling.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Fat-free: </strong>Less than 0.5 grams of fat per serving, with
          no added fat or oil.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Gluten-free:</strong> Less than 20 parts per million of gluten.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>High Potency:</strong> Individual vitamins or minerals that are
          present at 100% RDI.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>High-fiber:</strong> 5 grams or more of fiber per serving.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>High/Rich in/Excellent:</strong> Contains 20% or more of the
          recommended daily intake (RDI).
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Hyaluronic Acid:</strong> A molecule found in high quantities in
          synovial fluid. This molecule helps the synovial fluid provide
          lubrication for joints and allows bone surfaces and cartilage to glide
          on each other.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Joint:</strong> This is the union of two bones. There are
          several types of joints; some such as the knee joint and the hip
          joint&nbsp;allow for a lot of movement, while others such as the joints
          between the bones in the skull don’t allow for much movement at all.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Less fat:</strong> 25% or less fat than the comparison food.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Low cholesterol: </strong>20 mg or less cholesterol per serving
          and 2 grams or less saturated fat per serving.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Low fat:</strong> 2 grams of fat or less per serving.
        </p>

          <strong>Low sodium:</strong> 140mg or less per serving.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Non-steroidal Anti-inflammatory Drug:</strong> A type of drug
          that prevents inflammation. Common examples include aspirin and
          ibuprofen. These drugs work by stopping certain processes in the body
          that lead to inflammation. NSAIDs can relieve pain, swelling, redness
          and heat production in areas of inflammation.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Organic:</strong> Food meets standards set by the U.S Department
          of Agriculture.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Viscoelastic:</strong> A property of materials that exhibit both
          viscous and elastic characteristics when undergoing deformation.{" "}
