                    <p>
                        Degenerative arthritis, also known as ‘Osteoarthritis’ (OA),
                        results from a complex interplay of multiple factors,
                        including loss of joint cartilage integrity, genetics, local
                        inflammation, abnormal alignment, excessive mechanical
                        forces, and impaired cellular and biochemical processes.
                        Loss of articular cartilage tissue results in an irregular
                        joint bearing surface, which can impair joint function and
                        the homeostasis of joint tissues.<sup>1</sup> In patients
                        with OA, there is an imbalance of breakdown and repair of
                        tissues within a synovial joint. Thinning of cartilage is a
                        normal consequence of aging, and it is important to remember
                        that thinning of the cartilage layer is not pain-causing in
                        and of itself and many patients can be pain-free despite
                        having thin cartilage. In fact, painful OA can occur in
                        younger patients where it is often a consequence of injury
                        or overuse.{" "}

                        Hips, knees, hands and spines are the most commonly affected
                        joints. Osteoarthritis is subdivided by etiology. In primary
                        idiopathic OA, the origin of the disease is unknown and it
                        progresses slowly over a period of years. In secondary OA,
                        the disease is believed to be related to a specific inciting
                        event such as trauma, other joint related disease, or
                        congenital, developmental or endocrine disorders.
