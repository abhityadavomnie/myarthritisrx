      <h2 className="head">What is My Risk of Progression?</h2>
      <div className="content">
        <p>
          The most common risk factors that have been linked to osteoarthritis
          progression include: age, female gender, obesity, occupation, sports
          activities, previous injury, muscle weakness, metabolic and hormonal
          disorders.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Age:</strong> 4.2% of individuals from 20-39 suffer from
          osteoarthritis, 15.5% of adults from 40-64 suffer from osteoarthritis,
          and 32.5% of adults from 65 onwards suffer from osteoarthritis.
          <sup>1</sup> However, studies have shown that the prevalence of
          degenerative arthritis is increasing in all age groups.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Gender:</strong> Females have an increased risk of the
          development osteoarthritis after menopause. The risk of developing
          degenerative arthritis for women has been estimated to be 2.6 times
          greater than men after adjustment for age, weight, and smoking.
          <sup>2,3 </sup>Women with degenerative arthritis are also more likely
          than men to experience rapid structural damage and to undergo total hip
          arthroplasty.<sup>2,3</sup> Although advanced age and gender are not
          risk factors that can be prevented, awareness and management of
          degenerative arthritis can help reduce the severity and slow the
          progression of the disease.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Obesity: </strong>Excess weight adds additional pressure to the
          joints, leading to more bone on bone friction and cartilage loss. There
          is a strong association between obesity and knee osteoarthritis.
          Fortunately, weight loss leads to a decreased risk of the development of
          degenerative arthritis as well and limits its progression.<sup>4</sup>{" "}
          For every pound of weight one loses, 3 to 5 pounds of force can be
          reduced on a joint that is standing, and 7-10 pounds of force when
          climbing stairs. Even a small amount of weight reduction can lead to a
          significantly decreased load on a diseased joint.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Occupation: </strong>Degenerative arthritis has been linked with
          specific occupations such as cotton workers, dock workers, shipyard
          workers, and carpenters.<sup>5,6</sup> Certain occupational activities,
          especially those related to repetitive knee-bending and high demand
          activities, appear to be risk factors for the development of knee
          degenerative arthritis. Hip and hand degenerative arthritis have been
          associated with occupations that are physically intensive on the
          affected joint.<sup>7</sup>
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Strenuous activity: </strong>Several studies have compared the
          prevalence of osteoarthritis (degenerative arthritis) in groups engaged
          in regular exercise. The following sports were associated with an
          increased risk of degenerative arthritis in the indicated joints.
          <sup>8</sup>

        <ul className="bullet-list">
          <li>Wrestling (cervical spine, knees and elbows)</li>
          <li>Boxing (carpometacarpal joints)</li>
          <li>Pitching in baseball (shoulders and elbows)</li>
          <li>Cycling (patellofemoral joints)</li>
          <li>Recreational parachuting (spine, knees and ankles)</li>
          <li>Cricket (fingers)</li>
          <li>Gymnastics (shoulders, wrists and elbows)</li>
          <li>Ballet dancing (talar joints)</li>
          <li>Soccer (hips, knees, ankles, cervical spine and talar joints)</li>
          <li>Football (knees, feet and ankles)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          <strong>Previous injury:</strong> Studies have corroborated the
          association between existing ligamentous or meniscal injury to the knee
          and the subsequent risk of developing degenerative arthritis.
          <sup>9-12</sup>
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Genetics:</strong> Unlike weight and tobacco, genetics cannot be
          changed by modifying one’s habits. Genes such as the VDR, AGC1,
          ER-alpha, TGF-beta, CRTM, and CRTL gene have all been associated with
          the development of osteoarthritis.<sup>13</sup> The VDR gene is of
          particular interest since it codes for the vitamin D receptor in cells
          throughout the body. If mutated, cells may not respond properly to the
          presence of vitamin D, and mutations here have been shown to increase
          susceptibility to osteoarthritic changes.<sup>14,15</sup>&nbsp;Low
          levels of vitamin D or improper response to vitamin D can both
          contribute to osteoarthritis, as there may be a reduction in mechanical
          compliance to physical stress, shock-absorbing capacity, and
          regeneration of bone. Vitamin D is crucial in calcium absorption, bone
          ossification, increasing bone density and bone regenerating.
          <sup>16</sup> Any deficiency involving vitamin D can have dire
          consequences in bone formation and may exacerbate osteoarthritis risk.
