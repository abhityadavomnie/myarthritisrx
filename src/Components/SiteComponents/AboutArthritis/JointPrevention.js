          Joint preservation can prevent the progression of
          osteoarthritis&nbsp;and involves a combination of health management,
          medical and surgical interventions. The goal of joint preservation is to
          delay or prevent the need for total joint replacement. In an ideal
          situation, this can be done whilst maintaining the lifestyle and
          activity requirements of a patient with arthritis. Although this is not
          always possible, the goal of MyArthritisRx is to provide the patient
          with the treatment and coping skills necessary to maintain activity and
          minimize symptoms, as well as avoid total joint replacement.

          It is important to know how to correctly move your joints in order to
          cause the least amount of stress and cartilage damage. Simple things
          like changing the way you sit, stand, lie down and lift can prevent
          future injury and improve the overall well-being of your joints.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nutrition and exercise play a vital role in joint preservation and
          should be well-managed in addition to considering medical or surgical
          intervention. Damage to joints can further reduce mobility, which can
          lead to many other problems. These problems include obesity, a sedentary
          lifestyle and reduced cardiovascular health, all of which can contribute
          to diseases like diabetes or heart attacks.

          Joint preservation allows the patient to be in control of their body,
          gain a sense of independence and lead a healthy, active life. Too much
          activity, however, can lead to joint damage and it is important to take
          all of this into account before following a regimen.{" "}

          understanding of your illness, target your physical activity, plan
          better meal and nutritional options and perform exercises that can best
          improve your health. You will be given the tools to prevent or identify
          degenerative arthritis at its early stages, limiting the long-term
