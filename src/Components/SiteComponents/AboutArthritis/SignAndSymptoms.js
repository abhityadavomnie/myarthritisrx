      <h2>What Are the Signs and Symptoms of degenerative arthritis?</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>
          The symptoms of Arthritis can vary greatly from person to person, but
          may include:
        </strong>
      </p>
      <ul className="bullet-list">
        <li>
          <strong>Pain, </strong> especially chronic arthritis pain, can be
          exacerbated by activity and relieved by rest.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Referred pain</strong> (also known as reflective pain) is when
          soreness occurs in a place that is not the source of the pain. For
          example, osteoarthritis in the hip can cause pain in the anterior thigh
          as well as leading to knee joint pain.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Stiffness</strong> after periods of inactivity. Morning
          stiffness is also very common but usually goes away within an hour of
          rising in individuals with osteoarthritis.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Joint swelling</strong> can occur when there is excess fluid
          accumulation in areas such as the knee further increasing any chronic
          arthritis pain.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Bone popping/cracking</strong> (or crepitus) can result from the
          development of bone spurs that are expressed as bony protuberances under
          the skin and around the joint.
        </li>
      </ul>
