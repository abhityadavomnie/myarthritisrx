          <p>
            Mindfulness is a type of meditation based on the act of living in
            the present moment rather than thinking about the past or the
            future. It has many proven benefits; patients that practice it state
            that it helps them understand where the pain is coming from, lowers
            stress levels, allows to better connect with others, improves focus
            on what they are doing and reduces brain clutter and internal
            dialogue to give relief<sup>1</sup>. In fact, patients with chronic
            conditions causing pain reported several benefits to their level of
            pain, well-being and ability to tolerate or even enjoy life again
            after practicing mindful meditation.<sup>1</sup>

            Yoga has also been found to be of benefit for patients that suffer
            from osteoarthritis. In one study, researchers examined the effects
            of yoga on osteoarthritic patients receiving ultrasound and
            electrical stimulation treatment. Reduced pain levels, morning
            stiffness, state and anxiety, blood pressure and pulse were all
            found to be lowered in patients practicing yoga in comparison to
            patients that received electrical stimulation and ultrasound
            treatment alone<sup>17</sup>.

          <p>
            Tai Chi is a traditional Chinese exercise that involves the mind and
            the body with the goal of improving balance, strength, flexibility
            and mood. It can have a variety of positive effects such as reducing
            pain, depression and anxiety.<sup>1</sup> Researchers at Tufts
            Medical Center demonstrated that Tai Chi can benefit individuals
            with osteoarthritis; when asked to practice Tai Chi in bi-weekly
            1-hour sessions, they found that patients had significantly reduced
            levels of depression, increased function and a higher sense of
            independence compared to individuals that were not enrolled in the
            sessions.<sup>2</sup> A similar study found that Tai Chi also
            significantly improved balance and arthritic symptoms for women with
            osteoarthritis.<sup>3</sup>{" "}

          <p>
            Acupuncture is a therapy involving the insertion of fine needles at
            specific points in the body to facilitate stimulation and recovery.
            Studies have shown that it can be specifically utilized for patients
            with chronic pain.<sup>1,2</sup> Several studies performed on
            patients with osteoarthritis demonstrated that, in addition to
            normal medical therapy, individuals treated with acupuncture had
            lower overall levels of pain and increased levels of functionality.

            With any type of inflammation, wrapping and icing can offer

            {" "}
            <strong>Icing</strong> has been shown to reduce inflammation and
            swelling. When inflammation and fluid collection has decreased, a
            heating pad is an effective means of stimulating blood flow to the
            affected area. With increased blood flow, the additional oxygen and
            healing mediators help repair the affected joint.{" "}

            {" "}
            <strong>Bracing</strong> is also a very beneficial aspect of
            treatment. There are three types of knee braces commercially
            available for patients with degenerative joint disease: compression
            knee sleeves, supportive knee braces and unloading knee braces.
            Individuals wearing knee braces often report feeling security,
            support, warmth and stability.<sup>1</sup>{" "}

            Shoe wear and orthotics are also important considerations for
            patients with osteoarthritis. Energy-absorbing shoes with proper
            padding can help alleviate the impact and prevent trauma to both the
            knee and hip. An arch support, a calcaneal cushion and a rigid form
            can all help align the foot properly and improve mobility.

            Mobility is one of the most important factors for individuals with
            osteoarthritis. As joint function decreases, normal activities such
            as going to the bathroom or kitchen become exceedingly difficult.
            With this in mind, there are a number of devices that can assist in
            alleviating pain, providing stability and restoring function to
            individuals with osteoarthritis.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>The cane.</strong> Simple in construction, a cane can be
            made of wood, metal or plastic. Canes offer balance and redistribute
            weight to better suit a person’s needs and have been shown to
            significantly reduce pain levels, increase mobility and raise
            quality of life in patients.<sup>1</sup>
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Crutches</strong> are other useful assistance devices that
            can help people get around. There are four basic types: the forearm
            crutch, underarm crutch, platform crutch and leg support crutch.{" "}
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>The forearm crutch</strong> allows individuals to insert
            their arms in a sleeve and then grip onto a handle.{" "}
          </p>
          <p>
            {" "}
            <strong>The underarm crutch</strong>, or axillary crutch, is usually
            propped under the arm in the armpit.<sup>2</sup>{" "}
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>The platform crutch</strong> utilizes a surface on which the
            forearm can rest.{" "}
          </p>
          <p>
            {" "}
            <strong>The leg support crutch</strong> supports the lower leg and
            these can come equipped with wheels to allow patients to slide their
            affected leg forward rather than lift it.

            <strong>Walkers</strong> can offer support to both sides of the
            body. They allow patients to lean forward and move at their own
            pace. Scooters and wheelchairs can also provide mobility for
            patients with minimal exertion. Scooters tend to be battery powered
            and individuals simply sit on them and drive around, similar to a
            car.{" "}

            {" "}
            <strong>Wheelchairs</strong> can be electric, similar to scooters,
            or manual. While electric scooters and wheelchairs can significantly
            ease the burden of motility for individuals, the downside of these
            devices is their reliance on electric power. Manual wheelchairs can
            be operated by either the person sitting on the chair or through
            assistance from a caregiver.{" "}

            Pressure from everyday activities can be unavoidable, but there are
            ways that you can relieve this. Think of your joints like any other
            part of your body: you need to warm them up to loosen them. Getting
            up and moving around every 15 minutes can help prevent discomfort.{" "}

            It is also important to complete a movement check of your jaw, neck,

            programs begin 6-8 weeks prior to surgery and reduce risk,
            particularly of wound-related complications. This kind of

          <p>
            Obese patients undergoing total joint replacements experience
            improvements in mobility, pain and lower limb function. However,
            they’re also at risk of immediate and long-term post-operative
            complications including infection (superficial and deep). Longer
            operating time, difficult surgical exposure, decreased
            vascularization of fatty tissue and weakened immune response may
            contribute to increased infection rates. Obese patients&nbsp;also
            experience less significant improvements when compared to their
            non-obese counterparts.
          </p>
          <p>
            Recovery may also be slower and more difficult for obese patients,
            who tend to have higher pain scores ahead of undergoing total joint
            replacement. Increased nutritional deficiencies and risk of
            postoperative infection have been observed. Weight loss can delay
            surgical intervention and can promote joint and overall health in an
            arthritic patient.<sup>1-3</sup>

          <p>
            Emotional responses to pain are also related to the outcome of a
            surgery. It is important that these are included in a pre-surgical
            risk modification program. Pain, especially when catastrophically
            expressed, is an important psychological issue associated with
            osteoarthritis. Depression and catastrophizing can also mean a
            longer hospital stay.<sup>1</sup>{" "}
          </p>
          <p>
            Management includes: educating patients about arthritis and hip
            function; cognitive behavioral methods; and relaxation techniques.
            All of these can result in reducing the patient’s experience of
            pain.<sup>2</sup> Cognitive-behavioral techniques (derived from
            psychotherapy) have been developed specifically to address
            psychological risk factors in patients with musculoskeletal
            injuries. This approach increases the patient’s sense of
            self-efficacy and control over pain, reduces pain-related distress
            and replaces focus on pain with meaningful activities. <sup>3</sup>{" "}
            Improved pain management may also be a way for you to delay the need
            for invasive intervention.
          </p>
          <p>
            Post-operative cognitive decline (POCD) is also associated with
            increased mortality, as well as prolonged time spent in hospital.{" "}
            <sup>4-6</sup> An example is delirium (characterized by fluctuating
            consciousness and inattention), which has been reported in elderly
            patients undergoing elective orthopaedic surgery at a rate of
            between 9-28%. Risks associated with POCD include age, gender,
            pre-operative cognitive impairment (i.e. dementia) as well as a
            history of alcohol abuse and narcotic use.<sup>6,8,9</sup> It may be
            possible to reduce the risk of POCD through treatment of alcohol
            abuse and managing pre-operative narcotic use.{" "}
          </p>
          <p>
            Alcohol abuse is an independent risk factor. Patients with a history
            of alcohol and drug abuse are likely to have trouble with pain
            control. They may also develop complications (pneumonia, sepsis, PE
            and infection) that mean a longer hospital&nbsp;stay and can limit
            rehabilitation.<sup>10,11</sup> Treating alcohol and drug abuse
            ahead of surgery can mean a better outcome for the patient.{" "}

            Patients with ambulatory mobility problems are also at risk for
            longer rehabilitation and stay in hospital. Pre-operative
            conditioning training, or “prehabilitation”, can help with function
            and independence following surgery. It’s been shown to reduce length
            of stay and hospital readmission for patients with pre-existing
            issues. Balance disorders and neuromuscular conditions that affect
            ambulation can also improved with “prehab programs”.<sup>1</sup>

            Evaluating risks within the home and putting fall risk prevention

          <p>
            8% of patients undergoing total joint replacement in the US have a
            diagnosis of Diabetes mellitus (DM) Types I and II and those with
            uncontrolled DM are more likely to experience complications. Total
            joint replacement patients are at a greater risk of cerebrovascular
            accident (CVA), urinary tract infection (UTI), paralytic ileus,
            infection, post-operative hemorrhage, transfusion and death.

          <h3 className="blue-color">Frailty</h3>
          <p>
            Frailty is a measure of your physiologic reserves and is experienced
            by many elderly patients. Reserves can be used up during periods of
            stress like undergoing surgery and may affect how a patient responds
            to a procedure. A study by Makary et al. defines frailty as
            weakness, weight loss, exhaustion, low physical activity and slow
            walking speed. They found that preoperative frailty was associated
            with an increased risk for postoperative complications and length of
            hospital stay.<sup>1</sup>
